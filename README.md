## Introduction
You will create an interactive text-based game using JavaScript. The goal is to apply what you've learned in class and build a fun and engaging game that we can all play together in the next class.

## Requirements

Your game must meet the following requirements:

1. **Variables and Constants**: Your game should include the use of variables and constants to store and manage game data and states.

2. **User Input**: The game must ask for user inputs that will be used to drive the story and make decisions within the game.

3. **String Interpolation**: Utilize string interpolation in your JavaScript code to create dynamic and engaging console output for the player.

4. **Type Casting**: Cast at least one of the user inputs to a different data type (e.g., convert a string to a number) and use it in your game logic.

## Work Steps
1. Define and initialize the variables you will need for your game
2. Ask users for any input you need
3. Output the story using user input and string interpolation
4. Feel free to use other coding concepts here if you feel too limited
